## About

_Swift Metal Plate_ is based off the [work I was doing for my Masters](https://github.com/mhamilt/CoupledFDPlateAndString) in [Acoustics and Music Techonology at University of Edinburgh / Edinburgh College of Art](http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk/amt_msc/).

A finite difference plate has become my 'Hello, World' for any new language / technology that I'm learning. In this case, Metal and [App Notarisation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev88332a81e) were being tackled.
